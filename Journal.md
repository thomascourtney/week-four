# Reflection

- A lot of times in digital history, views or theories are created based on the historical data that are often times not entirely true
  - In the reading "Confabulation in the humanities", two plausible stories are presented, the theories are entirely believable but are these stories are the complete opposite of one another (the graphs are multipled by -1)
  
- Many stories derived from digital historical data are often changed over time based on biases of the author

- Historical argumentation is often times based on someones opinion and how that person sees the data which could be different from another persons view
  - It is sort of a grey area and not so black and white as opposed to other subsections in history
  
- This process was different than what I have done before in other history classes because you're sort of creating your own personal narrative given the data
  - With Voyant Tools and Topic Models in R, it was interesting to see trends in data when selecting certain words or topics

- In digital history, some prior information should be necessary to create an argument since just looking at data can skew the consumer's viewpoint
  - A false disgital history argument can be very believable as we've seen in "Confabulation in the humanities"
